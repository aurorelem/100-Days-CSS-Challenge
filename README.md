# 100 DAYS CSS CHALLENGE:

For 100 consecutive days, I've written HTML and CSS snippets as a creative learning process for myself.

I used CodePen to write and save my code and published my results every day on this website.

After accomplishing my project on day 100, I've rewritten the website to let everyone else also join my challenge.

## Day 1:
